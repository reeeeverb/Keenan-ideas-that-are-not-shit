## Keenan Ideas

### He will never actually work on any of these despite them being pretty good ideas

#### Collab Book
- 2 different books that are read by 2 people that functions as a game 
- the books can pit the 2 players against each other or have them work collaboritively to achieve a common goal

#### Minecraft/GMod Map
- similar to the book
- 2 players believe they are going to spawn and work together to achieve a goal but they are secretly pitted against each other and work in isolated areas of the map
